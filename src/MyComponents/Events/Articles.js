            We're thrilled to share insights from the Career Counselling Program organized by the Students' Welfare Group on behalf of the North-East Students'Forum, IIT Kharagpur!
This impactful initiative aimed to provide the second year northeastern UG students with invaluable guidance and support as they navigate their framed journeys.
We hope that they have gained a lot from this session and definitely it will make their forthcoming path smoother.
